# Sliding Window Algorithm

## Background Introduction
The sliding window technique uses two pointers to maintain a continuous interval in an array or string, often applied to find the longest or shortest subarray/substring. It has two main types: 

- **Fixed-size window**: Window length is constant, suitable for problems involving subarrays of length k
- **Variable-size window**: Window expands or shrinks dynamically by moving pointers, useful for optimal sub-interval problems

The main advantage is avoiding redundant calculations, reducing time complexity from O(NÂ²) to O(N). Commonly used in subarray sums, substring matching, frequency counting, and distinct-element problems.
