## ðŸ”¹ Background
A hash table (or hash map / hash set) stores data in key-value pairs and allows O(1) average-time access for insertion, deletion, and search.

It uses a hash function to map each key to an index in an array. Hash-based structures are powerful because they can quickly handle tasks such as frequency counting, removing duplicates, checking existence, and verifying patterns.

## ðŸŽ¯ Common Use Cases
- **Lookups**: Checking if an element exists in a set or dictionary
- **Counting**: Tracking frequency of elements (e.g., counting words)  
- **Mapping**: Storing associations like ID-Name or Key-Value pairs
- **Deduplication**: Removing duplicate elements from collections
